# Anomaly Detection in System Log Files

## Project Description
This project is a simple anomaly detection system that identifies unusual patterns in system log files using machine learning techniques. It uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies based on the log level (e.g., INFO or ERROR). The project can help identify potential system failures or security breaches by flagging unusual log entries.
